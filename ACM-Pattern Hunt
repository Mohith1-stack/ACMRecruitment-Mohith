Steps for the pattern hunt :

Sequence given: 2, 6, 12, 20, …

Step 1: Look at the differences

6 - 2 = 4
12 - 6 = 6
20 - 12 = 8

So the differences are: 4, 6, 8 … (increasing by 2 each time).

Step 2: Continue the pattern

Next differences will be:

8 + 2 = 10
10 + 2 = 12

Step 3: Add these to the sequence

20 + 10 = 30
30 + 12 = 42

So, The next two terms are 30, 42.
