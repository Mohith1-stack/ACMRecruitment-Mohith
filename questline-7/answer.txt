Clue Analysis:
"Three masks conceal the truth — numbers turned to letters, letters twisted through time, and a language that favors = and /"
That points to:
Hexadecimal Encoding (numbers turned to letters)
ROT Cipher (letters twisted through time)
Base64 Encoding (a language that favors = and /)
Let’s reverse this stacking in the opposite order:
Hex to bytes
Decode as Base64
Apply ROT13 (or similar letter shift cipher)
Convert hex to bytes gives us:
b'UHZjdXJlUGJlYGlcg=='
Step 2: Base64 Decode
base64.b64decode("UHZjdXJlUGJlYGlcg==") → b'PHvcurePBeb`\\'
So decoded base64 gives us:
b'PHvcurePBeb`\\'
Step 3: Apply ROT13 (Caesar cipher)
Apply ROT13 to the alphabetic characters in `"PHvcurePBeb``
ROT13 swaps A↔N, B↔O, ..., M↔Z
Original: PHvcurePBeb\\
After ROT13:
P → C
H → U
v → i
c → p
u → h
r → e
e → r
P → C
B → O
e → r
b → o
Special characters like \ remain the same.
"PHvcurePBeb\\" → "CUipherCOro\\"
