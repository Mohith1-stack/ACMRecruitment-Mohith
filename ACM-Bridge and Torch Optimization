Bridge & Torch Optimal-Solution 

People: 1, 2, 7, 10 minutes. Torch required, max 2 people on bridge.
Minimum total time = 17 minutes.

Optimal move sequence (with times and running total)

1. 1 and 2 cross → 2 minutes. (Total 2)


2. 1 returns → 1 minute. (Total 3)


3. 7 and 10 cross together → 10 minutes. (Total 13)


4. 2 returns → 2 minutes. (Total 15)


5. 1 and 2 cross → 2 minutes. (Total 17)



All four are now across; nothing else gets added. Total = 17 minutes.

Why this is optimal (short explanation)

There are two useful general ways to move the two slowest people (7 and 10):

Option A: Send the two slowest together, using the two fastest to shuttle the torch: cost for that part ≈ 2*b + a + d (where a and b are the two fastest).

Option B: Have the fastest shuttle each slow one separately: cost ≈ 2*a + c + d.


With a=1, b=2, c=7, d=10:

Option A gives 2*2 + 1 + 10 = 15 for the big exchange (which fits into the 17 total when you include the initial/final crossings as arranged).

Option B gives 2*1 + 7 + 10 = 19, worse.


The shown sequence implements Option A (the better choice) and yields the global minimum 17. Any other plausible sequence gives a total ≥ 17, so 17 is optimal.
