1. Column 1 (c1): digits missing {1,2,4};

r2c1 ≠1 (row 2 already has 1 at c3)

r4c1 ≠1 (row 4 already has 1 at c2)
⇒ Only r1c1 can be 1 → r1c1 = 1.



2. Row 3 (r3): now looks like 3 . . ..
Column 2 already has a 1 (r4c2), and column 3 already has a 1 (r2c3), and r3c1 is 3.
⇒ The only place for 1 in row 3 is c4 → r3c4 = 1.


3. Box (rows 3–4, cols 3–4): it has r3c4 = 1, and column 3 already contains a 3 at r1c3, so in this box the 3 can’t go in c3.
⇒ r4c4 = 3.


4. Now propagate easy pairs:

Column 3 (c3): currently has 3 (r1c3), 1 (r2c3) → remaining {2,4} go to r3c3, r4c3.

Row 4 (r4): is . 1 . 3 → remaining {2,4} go to c1, c3.

Box (rows 1–2, cols 3–4): has r1c3=3, r2c3=1 → remaining {2,4} go to r1c4, r2c4.

Box (rows 1–2, cols 1–2): has r2c2=3, r1c1=1 → remaining {2,4} go to r1c2, r2c1.



5. From here the puzzle splits into a simple two-way choice (r1c2/r2c1 and r1c4/r2c4 each {2,4}). Both branches complete cleanly without contradiction.

Solution is :

1 2 3 4
4 3 1 2
3 4 2 1
2 1 4 3
