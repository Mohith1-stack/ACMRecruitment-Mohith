Solution

1. Turn Switch A ON and leave it on for about 1–2 minutes.


2. After that time, turn Switch A OFF and immediately turn Switch B ON.


3. Leave Switch C OFF the whole time.


4. Now go into the other room (only once) and observe the bulb:



If the bulb is on, it’s controlled by Switch B (you left B on).

If the bulb is off but warm/hot, it’s controlled by Switch A (it was on long enough to heat the bulb, then you turned it off).

If the bulb is off and cold, it’s controlled by Switch C (never turned on).


That single visit gives you the identity of each switch.
